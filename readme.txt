This repository sets up a fresh installation of Ubuntu/Debian flavors with important applications, languages, and dev environments.

It is recommended to run GalliumOS_DevEnv_Setup.sh before attempting to install the normal GalliumOS_DevEnv_Setup.sh. 

If you don't want any of the other installations that DevEnv_Setup performs, simply ensure that Node.js is installed. This is because of a node dependency required for Messenger. 

This was initially developed for GalliumOS on a Chromebook given a fresh install.
